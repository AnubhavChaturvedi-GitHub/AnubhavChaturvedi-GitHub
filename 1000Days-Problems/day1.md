Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
• If n is odd, print Weird
• If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
• If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
• If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

**Input Format:**
A single line containing a positive integer, n.

**Constraints:**
• 1 ≤ n ≤ 100

**Output Format:**
